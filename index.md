##Purpose of this site

This site is a project to support the sharing of pay ranges in job adverts. This is important for reasons included on [Show The Pay](www.showthepay.com)

The following list of companies started after I posted on LinkedIn asking for contributions.

I take and share all information on face value. If anyone wants to make corrections or additions, suggest them using a GitHub pull request. 

When I have the time and energy I will come up with an easier method.
