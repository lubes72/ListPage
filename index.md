## Welcome

This list of companies is taken from job adverts I have seen on LinkedIn or on their own website.

I take and share all information on face value. If anyone wants to make corrections or additions you can suggest them using a GitHub pull request. At least until I have the time and energy to come up with an easier method.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lubes72/ListPage/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
